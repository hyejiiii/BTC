        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"><b>chicken</b></a> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a
        domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild
        species
        such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl<sup><a href="source">[1]</a></sup> that are originally from
        Southeast Asia. Rooster and cock are
        terms
        <i>for adult male birds</i>, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a
        capon. An
        adult female bird is called a hen, <ins>and a sexually immature female</ins>s is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens
        primarily
        <del>as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally they were also bred for
        cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers and for
        eggs</del>
        are
        layers.
